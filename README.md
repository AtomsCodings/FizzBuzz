# FizzBuzz
A .Net Console Programming Exercise

I was given this exercise in an interview.  The instructions state:

"Choose one of the problems below and solve it using a C# console....

Fizz Buzz
Write a program that can be given a start and end integer and iterate over every number in that range.

When the number is a multiple of three, mark it as Fizz.
When the number is a multiple of five, mark it has Buzz.
When a number is a multiple of three and five, mark it has FizzBuzz.

The program should show the list to the user when it is done. "
